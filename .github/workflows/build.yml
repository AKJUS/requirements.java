      # Maven command-line options:
      # --batch-mode: recommended in CI to inform maven to not run in interactive mode (less logs)
      # -V: strongly recommended in CI, will display the JDK and Maven versions in use.
      #      Very useful to be quickly sure the selected versions were the ones you think.
      # -e: Display stack-traces on failure
